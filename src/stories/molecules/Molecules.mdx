# Molecules

In Atomic Design, Molecules are groups of Atoms (basic UI elements like buttons, inputs) that work together as a functional, cohesive unit, forming more complex components like a search bar (input + button + label) or a subscription form (input + button). They represent the second level of building interfaces, combining simple parts into meaningful chunks that can be reused across a design system, leading to consistency and efficiency.

**Key Characteristics of Molecules**

- Combination of Atoms: They are formed by bonding two or more atoms.
- Functional Units: They perform a specific task or provide a distinct piece of functionality.
- Reusable: Once created, a molecule (like a search form) can be dropped into various parts of a website.
- More Complex than Atoms: They have distinct properties and behaviors beyond their individual atomic parts.

**Examples**
- Search Form: An input field atom + a search button atom + a label atom.
- Navigation Item: An icon atom + a text label atom.
- Product Card (simplified): An image atom + a title atom + a price atom.

**How They Fit In**

- Atoms: Buttons, input fields, labels, colors, fonts (the smallest elements).
- Molecules: Atoms grouped into functional units (e.g., a search bar).
- Organisms: Molecules and atoms combined into complex sections (e.g., a header with a logo, navigation, and search molecule).
- Templates: Layouts of organisms, molecules, and atoms for a page structure.
- Pages: Templates with real content to show the final interface.
