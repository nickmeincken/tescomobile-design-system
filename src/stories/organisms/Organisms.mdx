# Organisms

Organisms are complex UI components made from groups of molecules (and atoms) that form distinct, reusable sections of an interface, like a website header (logo + navigation + search bar) or a product card, providing functional units that make up pages. They represent a higher level of complexity, combining smaller elements to create meaningful, standalone parts of a design system that can be arranged into templates and pages.

**Key Characteristics**

- Composition: Organisms combine multiple molecules (e.g., a search form molecule + a logo molecule + a navigation molecule).
- Functionality: They form complete, functional sections of a page, like footers, sidebars, or main navigation areas.
- Reusability: Once built, organisms can be reused across different templates and pages, promoting consistency.
- Hierarchy: They sit above molecules and atoms but below templates and pages in the Atomic Design hierarchy, adding significant structure.

**Examples**

- Website Header: A logo (atom/molecule), main navigation (molecule/organism), and search bar (molecule) combined.
- Product Card: Image (atom/molecule), product title (molecule), price (molecule), and "Add to Cart" button (molecule) grouped together.
- Footer: Copyright info (molecule), links (molecules), social icons (molecules).

**Why They Matter**

Organisms make design systems more manageable by grouping related molecules, allowing designers and developers to think about larger interface sections while still maintaining modularity, leading to faster development and better scalability.
