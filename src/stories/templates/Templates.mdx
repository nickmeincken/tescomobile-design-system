# Templates

Atomic Design Templates are the structure layer in the Atomic Design methodology, acting as wireframes for pages that arrange components (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms) into page-level layouts without final content or styling, establishing the blueprint for different page types (like Home, Product, Blog) to ensure consistency, scalability, and easier collaboration between designers and developers.

**What Templates Do**

- **Define Structure**: Show where components sit on a page (e.g., "header goes here, sidebar goes here, main content area here").
- **Establish Layouts**: Create reusable layouts for different page types (e.g., a standard blog post template).
- **Bridge Components & Pages**: Connect the complex organisms to the final, content-filled pages.
- **Promote Consistency**: Ensure all pages built from a template have the same foundational structure.
