# Pages

In Atomic Design, Pages are the final, highest-fidelity stage where placeholder content in Templates is replaced with real, representative content, creating concrete, specific user interfaces to test the system's effectiveness and demonstrate actual use cases (like a full product page or checkout). They show how atoms, molecules, and organisms work together in context, revealing flaws and influencing updates to the foundational components for a truly robust and scalable design system.
