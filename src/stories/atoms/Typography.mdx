### Examples of using heading classes with content

To maintain a hierachy of content, we often want to add a h1 styling to a lower content structure to maintain a good SEO performance, although this is a small ranking factor. It is also helpful for users of screenreaders so they're not jumping all over the page.

It is wise to keep this structure in place, a handy chrome extension to monitor this structure can be found here: <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/afoibpobokebhgfnknfndkgemglggomo?utm_source=item-share-cb">HTML5 Outliner</a>

The below example is just for `h1` tags but can be applied to any content level block.

<p className="h1">P tag with `h1` class</p>
<span className="h1">Span with `h1` class</span>
<h1>Deafault Heading 1</h1>
<h1 className="h2">Heading 1 with `h2` class</h1>
<h1 className="h3">Heading 1 with `h3` class</h1>
<h1 className="h4">Heading 1 with `h4` class</h1>
<h1 className="h5">Heading 1 with `h5` class</h1>
<h1 className="h6">Heading 1 with `h6` class</h1>
